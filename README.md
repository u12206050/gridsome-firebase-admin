## Directory Setup

  **rules/**: Contains all Firestore rules that will get merged thanks to [Firestore-rulez](https://github.com/lupas/firestore-rulez)

  **graphql/**: WIP - A graphql server for your Firsestore collections

  **firestore.rules**: Do not edit this file as it will be
  overwritten everytime `firestore-rulez` is run
